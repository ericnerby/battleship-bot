# Battleship Bot

## About the Project

When you play Battleship against another person, part of the thrill and disappointment is waiting for their response or looking at your board and having to give your response (like telling them they just got a hit or they just sunk your battleship). This is part of what makes Battleship a fun game to play. It's satisfying waiting for and then getting that response, and it's gut-wrenching having to give your response.

That experience is often lacking when you play Battleship against a computer. You don't get to tell your opponent whether they got a hit or a miss, the game just magically makes a red mark on one of your ships or a white mark in your open water.

I wanted to do something different. This is a command line app that plays a game of Battleship with you. You set up half of your board just like you were playing against another human, and the game doesn't know where anything is until you respond to its guesses (and given the possibility of a ship being sunk, the game will prompt you whether a ship was sunk when the computer gets a hit).

As you can see, I'm slowly building the game right now (as a project for my Code Louisville Python course), so check back later and hopefully there will be a fun game waiting for you in the future!
