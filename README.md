# Battleship Bot

## About the Project

When you play Battleship against another person, part of the thrill and disappointment is waiting for their response or looking at your board and having to give your response (like telling them they just got a hit or they just sunk your battleship). This is part of what makes Battleship a fun game to play. It's satisfying waiting for and then getting that response, and it's gut-wrenching having to give your response.

That experience is often lacking when you play Battleship against a computer. You don't get to tell your opponent whether they got a hit or a miss, the game just magically makes a red mark on one of your ships or a white mark in your open water.

I wanted to do something different. This is a command line app that plays a game of Battleship with you. You set up half of your board just like you were playing against another human, and the game doesn't know where anything is until you respond to its guesses (and given the possibility of a ship being sunk, the game will prompt you whether a ship was sunk when the computer gets a hit).

As you can see, I'm slowly building the game right now (as a project for my Code Louisville Python course), so check back later and hopefully there will be a fun game waiting for you in the future!

## Getting the App to Run

This section will walk through getting the app set up to run on any computer eventually.

## Playing a Game

If you have a game of battleship in the house, set up half of it like you were sitting across from someone and then play against the computer in the app.

If you don't have a game of battleship handy, you can use the Google Sheets template I built instead, either printing out a copy or filling it out right in the browser:
